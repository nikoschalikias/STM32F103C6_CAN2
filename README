Testing CAN-BUS of CANALL_V2 boards
Targeting:
* Free Tool chain
* Use no libraries
* Initialise everything directly to register level
* Traffic to CAN-BUS only when event happens
* No HOST, only nodes 

*canALL_V2 boards connected on CAN-BUS network
*Software on 
:Atollic TrueSTUDIO®/STM32 Lite, Built on Eclipse.
:Version: 2.0.1 Lite
:Build id: 20110128-1032
*Send to CAN only when an input is changed
*All Receiving boards transmit to UART
:CAN-BUS can be monitored on PC Terminal Emulator
*On progress:
:'''Use board addressing to activate outputs from other board inputs'''
:// TODO: In COMMON+ mode: if Identifier matches  CAN Rx --> OUT1...8
