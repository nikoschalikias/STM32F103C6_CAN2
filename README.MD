# STM32F103C6_CAN2
Testing CAN-BUS operation with [CANALL_V2]() boards  

**Targeting:**

*  Free Tool chain
*  Use no libraries
*  Initialise everything directly to register level
*  Traffic to CAN-BUS only when event happens
*  No HOST, only nodes 

*  canALL_V2 boards connected on CAN-BUS network  


**Software on:** 

  * Atollic TrueSTUDIOÂ®/STM32 Lite, Built on Eclipse.
  * Version: 2.0.1 Lite
  * Build id: 20110128-1032
*  Send to CAN only when an input is changed
*  All Receiving boards transmit to UART
   *  CAN-BUS can be monitored on PC Terminal Emulator  


**On progress:**

   *  Use board addressing to activate outputs from other board inputs
   *  *todo:* In COMMON+ mode, if Identifier matches  CAN Rx --> OUT1...8
